Airtest
=======

Automated Testing Framework

Getting Started
---------------

Airtest is an automated testing framework with main focus on games,
however it can be used for other native applications as well. Currently,
Windows and Android operating systems are supported. Support for iOS
comes in near future.

Airtest framework is based on image recognition technology and provides
cross-platform APIs that allows to install application, perform
simulated input, make assertions, and so forth. It also generates the
report when testing is finished.

**AirtestIDE** is an out of the box GUI tool that helps to create and
record test cases in the user-friendly way. AirtestIDE provides QA with
entire production workflow: ``record -> replay -> report``

Installation
------------

This section describes how to install Airtest test framework.

System Requirements
...................

-  Operating System:

   -  Windows
   -  MacOS X
   -  Linux

-  Python2.7 & Python3.3+

Installing the python package
..............................

Airtest package can be installed directly from Git repository. Use
``pip`` to manage installation of all python dependencies and package
itself.

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/Meteorix/airtest.git
    pip install -e airtest

    # for netease internal gitlab
    # git clone ssh://git@git-qa.gz.netease.com:32200/gzliuxin/airtest.git

Use ``-e`` here to install airtest in develop mode since this repo is in
rapid development. Then you can upgrade the repo with ``git pull``
later.


Documentation
-------------

For now please clone this repo and open ``docs-release/index.html``.

Online docs will be available on readthedocs when this project is
released.


Basic Usage
-----------------------

Airtest provides simple APIs that are platform independent. This section
describes how to create simple API-specific test scenario which does the
following:

1. connects to local android device with ``adb``
2. installs the ``apk`` application
3. runs application and takes the screenshot
4. performs several user operations (touch, swipe, keyevent)
5. uninstalls application

.. code:: python

    from airtest.core.api import *

    # connect to local device with adb
    connect_device("Android:///")

    # start your script here
    install("path/to/your/apk")
    start_app("package_name_of_your_apk")
    snapshot("my_screenshot.png")
    touch((100, 100))
    touch("image_of_a_button.png")
    swipe((100, 100), (200, 200))
    swipe("button1.png", "button2.png")
    keyevent("BACK")
    home()
    uninstall("package_name_of_your_apk")


For more detailed info, please refer to full `Airtest Python API
reference`_ or take a look at `API code`_


Connect Device
..................

Airtest aims at providing platform independent api, so that you can write test once and run test on different devices.
Using ``connect_device`` API you can connect to any android device or windows application.

.. code:: python

    connect_device("platform://host:port/uuid?param=value&param2=value2")


Connect android device
**************************

Local device

1. Connect your android phone to your PC with usb
2. Use ``adb devices`` to make sure the state is ``device``
3. Connect device in Airtest
4. If you have multiple devices or even remote devices, use more params to specify the device

.. code:: python

    # connect a local adb device using default params
    connect_device("android:///")

    # connect a remote device using custom params
    connect_device("android://adbhost:adbport/1234566?cap_method=javacap&touch_method=adb")


Connect windows application
****************************

.. code:: python

    # connect local windows desktop
    connect_device("Windows:///")

    # connect local windows application
    connect_device("Windows:///title_re=unity.*")


For more windows params, please see **pywinauto** documentation.


Simulate Input
...............

Following APIs are fully supported:
1. touch
2. swipe
3. text
4. keyevent
5. snapshot
6. wait

More APIs are available, some of which may be platform specific, please see `API docs`_ for more information.


Make Assertion
...............

Airtest provide some assert functions, including:
1. assert_exists
2. assert_not_exists
3. assert_equal
4. assert_not_equal

When assertion fails, it will raise ``AssertsionError``. And you will see all assertions in the html report.




Trying Samples
--------------

Airtest also contains the samples using this library in several
scenarios. All samples can be found in ``playground`` directory in
cloned repository.


Running from CLI
-----------------------------------
Airtest can be run from command line interface as well. All test cases, test code and image templates must be placed in one directory with `.owl` suffix. The easiest way to create and record the test cases is to use GUI **Airtest IDE**.

The biggest advantage of using the Airtest CLI is the possibility to execute the test cases and test scenarios on different host machine without using IDE itself. Connections to devices are specified by command line arguments, i.e. the test code is platform independent and one code, test cases, scenarios can be used for Android, Windows or iOS devices as well. 

Following examples demonstrate the basic usage of airtest framework from CLI. For more detailed info, refer to provided samples of test cases and code: ```airtest/playground/test_blackjack.owl/```
