Airtest
=======

**UI Test Automation Framework for Games and Apps**


.. image:: demo.gif


Getting Started
---------------

Airtest is a cross-platform automated testing framework with main focus on games,
which can also be used for native apps. Currently, Windows and Android are well supported.
Support for iOS comes in near future.

Airtest provides cross-platform APIs, including app installation, simulated input, assertion and so forth. Airtest uses image recognition technology to locate UI elements, so that you can automate test on games without injecting any code. After running the test, an HTML report will be generated automatically, that allows you to quickly locate failed test points.

**AirtestIDE** is an out of the box GUI tool that helps to create and
record test cases in the user-friendly way. AirtestIDE provides QA with
a complate production workflow: ``record -> replay -> report``

Installation
------------

This section describes how to install Airtest test framework.

System Requirements
...................

-  Operating System:

   -  Windows
   -  MacOS X
   -  Linux

-  Python2.7 & Python3.3+


Installing the python package
..............................

Airtest package can be installed directly from Pypi. Use
``pip`` to manage installation of all python dependencies and package
itself.

.. code:: shell

    pip install airtest


You can also install it from Git repository.

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/AirtestProject/Airtest.git
    pip install -e airtest


Use ``-e`` here to install airtest in develop mode since this repo is in
rapid development. Then you can upgrade the repo with ``git pull``
later.


Documentation
-------------

You can find the airtest documentation on `readthedocs`_


Basic Usage
-----------------------

Airtest provides simple APIs that are platform independent. This section
describes how to create simple API-specific test scenario which does the
following:

1. connects to local android device with ``adb``
2. installs the ``apk`` application
3. runs application and takes the screenshot
4. performs several user operations (touch, swipe, keyevent)
5. uninstalls application

.. code:: python

    from airtest.core.api import *

    # connect to local device with adb
    connect_device("Android:///")

    # start your script here
    install("path/to/your/apk")
    start_app("package_name_of_your_apk")
    snapshot("my_screenshot.png")
    touch((100, 100))
    touch("image_of_a_button.png")
    swipe((100, 100), (200, 200))
    swipe("button1.png", "button2.png")
    keyevent("BACK")
    home()
    uninstall("package_name_of_your_apk")


For more detailed info, please refer to `Airtest Python API
reference`_ or take a look at `API code`_


Connect Device
..................

Airtest aims at providing platform independent api, so that you can write test once and run test on different devices.
Using ``connect_device`` API you can connect to any android device or windows application.

.. code:: python

    connect_device("platform://host:port/uuid?param=value&param2=value2")


Connect android device
**************************

Local device

1. Connect your android phone to your PC with usb
2. Use ``adb devices`` to make sure the state is ``device``
3. Connect device in Airtest
4. If you have multiple devices or even remote devices, use more params to specify the device

.. code:: python

    # connect a local adb device using default params
    connect_device("android:///")

    # connect a remote device using custom params
    connect_device("android://adbhost:adbport/1234566?cap_method=javacap&touch_method=adb")


Connect windows application
****************************

.. code:: python

    # connect local windows desktop
    connect_device("Windows:///")

    # connect local windows application
    connect_device("Windows:///?title_re=unity.*")


Airtest uses `pywinauto` as Windows backend. For more window searching params, please see `pywinauto documentation`_.


Simulate Input
...............

Following APIs are fully supported:

- touch
- swipe
- text
- keyevent
- snapshot
- wait

More APIs are available, some of which may be platform specific, please see `API reference`_ for more information.


Make Assertion
...............

Airtest provide some assert functions, including:

- assert_exists
- assert_not_exists
- assert_equal
- assert_not_equal

When assertion fails, it will raise ``AssertsionError``. And you will see all assertions in the html report.




Trying Samples
--------------

Airtest also contains the samples using this library in several
scenarios. All samples can be found in ``playground`` directory in
cloned repository.


Running from CLI
-----------------------------------

Using AirtestIDE, you can easily create and author automated tests as ``.air`` directories.
Airtest CLI provides the possibility to execute tests on different host machine and target device platforms without using AirtestIDE itself.

Connections to devices are specified by command line arguments, i.e. the test code is platform independent and one code, test cases, scenarios can be used for Android, Windows or iOS devices as well. 

Following examples demonstrate the basic usage of airtest framework running from CLI. For a deeper understanding, try running provided test cases: ``airtest/playground/test_blackjack.air``


run test case
..............
.. code:: shell

    # run test test cases and scenarios on various devices
    > python -m airtest run <path to your air dir> --device Android:///
